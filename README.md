# SpeakFlow

Welcome to **SpeakFlow** â€“ Effortlessly convert your speech into text and translate it into any language, all from the web!

## Overview

SpeakFlow is a React-based web application that leverages web workers to run machine learning models directly in your browser. It uses `transformers.js` to perform speech-to-text transcription and supports translation into multiple languages.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Speech-to-Text**: Convert your audio input into text quickly and efficiently.
- **Translation**: Translate the transcribed text into any supported language.
- **Browser-Based ML**: No server required! The app runs ML models in the browser using web workers.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Perform tasks like downloading, loading, and inference in the background, ensuring smooth user experience.

## How It Works
- The app uses **web workers** to handle background tasks, ensuring the UI remains responsive while models are downloaded, loaded, and processed.
- You can upload an audio file or provide live audio input. The audio is decoded and sent to the worker, which runs the **Whisper model** from Hugging Face using `transformers.js`.
- Once the transcription is complete, you can see the results and optionally translate the text.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: As the build tool for fast development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Transformers.js**: A browser-compatible version of Hugging Face's transformers for running ML models.
- **Web Workers**: For running tasks in the background without blocking the UI.
